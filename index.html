            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Dylan Forster, a promising web developer/programmer. I'm currently studying full stack development and it's now become my passion. I've always had a fascination with technology and how it can be used to bring creative solutions to life through the power of code.</p>
            <p>Professionally, I've worked through various customer service jobs and have developed strong communication and problem-solving skills that I believe are essential in the tech industry. Not only this but it's helped provide me with a unique perspective on user experience and the importance of empathy in design.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, spending time with my friends and family, playing video games, and visiting new places. I find these things to be the perfect balance to my work and studies, allowing me to recharge and stay inspired.</p>
